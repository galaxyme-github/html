                    <strong>2. BFT Service.</strong>
                    <p>
                        <u>2.1 Nature of the BFT Service.</u> The BFT Service consists of a desktop Web application, mobile applications, and other related tools, support and services that 
                        “Buyers of Services” and Food Truck related services (“<strong>Food Truck Members</strong>”) can use to find, communicate with and interact with each other. The BFT Service 
                        includes our emergency support services, educational materials for Food Truck Members, and other services. We charge fees for some aspects of the BFT 
                        Service, as described below in Section 9.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <u>2.2 BFT does not provide Food Truck Services.</u> BFT is a neutral venue for Food Truck Members and Buyer of Services. BFT is not a Food Truck owner and, 
                        except for emergency phone support and other resources and support specifically described in the BFT Service, does not provide Food Truck catering services. 
                        We make no representations or warranties about the quality of food, service or other services provided by Food Truck Members, or about your interactions and 
                        dealings with users. Food Truck Members listed on BFT are not under the direction or control of BFT, and Food Truck Members determine in their own discretion 
                        how to provide Food Truck catering. Though we provide general guidance on our Site to Food Truck Members about safety and Food Truck catering and to 
                        Buyer of Services about selecting and engaging Food Truck Members, BFT does not employ, recommend or endorse Food Truck Members or Buyers of 
                        Services, and, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we will not be responsible or liable for the performance or conduct of Food Truck Members 
                        or Buyers of Services, whether online or off-line. We conduct an initial review of Food Truck Member profiles and we facilitate Background Checks or 
                        Identification Verifications (each as described in Section 7, below) on Food Truck Members conducted by a third party, but, except where explicitly specified in 
                        the BFT Service (and then only to the extent specified), do not otherwise screen Food Truck Members or Buyer of Services. You should exercise caution and use 
                        your independent judgment before engaging a Food Truck Member providing Food Truck Catering, or otherwise interacting with users via the BFT Service. 
                        Buyer of Services and Food Truck Members are solely responsible for making decisions that are in the best interests of themselves and their interest and business.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <u>2.3 Release.</u> <strong>BFT has no liability for any claims, injuries, loss, harm and/or damages arising from and/or in any way related to your interactions or dealings with 
                        other users and the acts and/or omissions of Food Truck Members and Buyer of Services, whether online or offline. You acknowledge and agree that, to the 
                        maximum extent permitted by the applicable law, YOUR USE AND/OR PROVISION OF FOOD TRUCK CATERING IS AT YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE RISK. 
                        (Any financial obligations BFT may have to its users in connection with user conduct are limited to the reimbursement obligations set forth in the Booking Food Trucks Guarantee.)</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <u>2.4 Transactions are between Buyers of Services and Food Truck Members.</u> The BFT Service may be used to find and offer Food Truck Catering and to 
                        facilitate payment, but all transactions conducted via the BFT Service are between Buyer of Services and Food Truck Members. Except for the limited refunds 
                        and “Reservation Protection” and the Booking Food Truck Guarantee, you agree that BFT has no liability for damages associated with Food Truck Catering or 
                        resulting from any other transactions between users of the BFT Services.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <u>2.5 Bookings.</u> Buyers of Services and Food Truck Members transact with each other on the BFT Service when they both agree to a “booking” that specifies the 
                        charge, time period, cancellation policy, and other terms for provision of Food Truck Catering via the booking mechanism provided on the BFT Service (a 
                        “Booking”). A Booking may be initiated by either a Food Truck Member or a Buyer of Service by selecting the type(s) of Food Truck Catering to be provided and 
                        then following the prompts that appear on-screen. If you are a Buyer of Service and you initiate a Booking, you agree to pay for the Food Truck Catering 
                        described in the Booking when you click “Request & Pay.” If you are a Buyer Service and a Food Truck Member initiates a Booking, you agree to pay for the Food 
                        Truck Catering described in the Booking when you click “Pay Now.” All requests are subject to acceptance by the receiving party. The receiving party is not 
                        obligated to accept your (or any) request and may, at their discretion, decline for any reason. You acknowledge that, once you complete a Booking, you agree to 
                        honor the price and other terms of that Booking, as acknowledged in the Booking confirmation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <u>2.6 Buyer of Services are Solely Responsible for Evaluating Service Providers.</u> Buyer of Services are solely responsible for evaluating the suitability of Food 
                        Truck Members for the services they offer to provide. Please visit the <a href="#" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="text-link">Help Center</a> for guidance about making informed decisions about engaging Food Truck 
                        Members. Though BFT performs a limited review of Food Truck Members profiles and facilitates Food Truck Members Background Checks or Identity 
                        Verifications conducted by a third party, any such screening is limited, and BFT does not warrant that any such screen is accurate, complete, conclusive or up-to-date. 
                        Similarly, BFT does not endorse reviews of Food Truck Members by other Buyer of Services that may be available via the BFT Service, and BFT makes 
                        no commitments that such reviews are accurate or legitimate.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Additional Terms of Service at https://maps.google.com/help/terms_maps.html (including the Acceptable Use Policy at https://cloud.google.com/maps-

                        result in your suspension or termination from the BFT Service.

                        <u>7.2 Fees for Buyers of Services.</u> Buyers of Services may purchase Catering Services from a Food Truck Member by completing a Booking as described in 
                        Section 2.5. If you are a Buyer of Service, you enter into a transaction with the Food Truck Member when you accept a Booking, and you agree to pay the total 
                        fees indicated in the Booking. As described in Sections 7.3 and 7.4, the total amount Buyers of Services are charged for a Booking may also include a service 
                        fee payable to BFT. Where required by law, the amount charged will also be inclusive of applicable taxes. The Food Truck Member, not BFT, is responsible for 
                        performing the Food Truck Catering Services.

                        <u>7.3 Fees for Food Truck Members.</u> Food Truck Members may agree to provide Food Truck Catering Services to a Buyer of Services by agreeing to a Booking as 
                        described in Section 2.5. If you are a Food Truck Member, you must confirm the Booking before it expires or the Buyer of Service will have no obligation to 
                        complete the transaction. Once the Booking is completed by both parties, you agree to honor the price set forth in your Booking. The purchase of Food Truck 
                        Members is a transaction between the Buyer Services and the Food Truck Members. BFT’s role is to facilitate the transaction. We will (either directly or 
                        indirectly through an authorized third party) collect payment from the Buyer of Service at the time of Booking and (except to the extent of any payment hold 
                        pursuant to Section 7.7) initiate payment to the Food Truck Members’s account 48 hours after completion of the service period indicated in the Booking. Food 
                        Truck Members are charged a service fee as described in Section 7.4. Where required by law, the amount charged will also be inclusive of applicable taxes.

                        <u>7.4 Service Fees.</u> We charge service fees for some aspects of the BFT Service. If you are a Food Truck Member, except where otherwise specified via the BFT 
                        Service, our service fee is calculated as a percentage of the fees a Buyer of Service agrees to pay to you in a Booking and is collected from each Booking. Our 
                        service fees are described here.

                                Truck Members when Food Truck Members cancel Bookings near the start date of the service period identified in the Booking. The availability of the 
                                Reservation Protection depends on the timing of the cancellation and the type of catering provided; consult the <a href="#" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="text-link">Reservation Protection</a> page for details.</p>

                                agreed in writing to accept a Booking) by contacting BFT to modify the Booking. If you do not find a substitute and repeatedly cancel accepted Bookings 
                                without justification, BFT may terminate your account.</p>

                                accordance with the cancellation policy selected by the Food Truck Member on the BFT Service. All Food Truck Members are required to select a cancellation

                                the policies and terms in this Section 7.6, the date of cancellation is the date that a user cancels through the BFT Service, regardless of any separate

                        <u>7.7 Authorization to Charge.</u> When you pay for Food Truck Catering Services or for other services on the BFT Service, you will be required to provide us with

                        your account so long as you have any outstanding, confirmed Bookings. BFT’s role is to facilitate payments from Buyer of Services to Food Truck Members as 
                        limited payment agent for the Service Provider. You authorize us to charge your credit card or other payment method for fees you incur on the BFT Service as 
                        they become due and payable, and to charge any alternative payment method BFT has on record for you in the event your primary payment method is expired, 
                        invalid, or otherwise not able to be charged. You are responsible for maintaining up-to-date payment information. If we cannot charge you for fees when due 
                        because your payment information is no longer valid, or if we do not receive your payment when due, then you understand that neither BFT nor the Food Truck 
                        Member will be responsible for any failure to provide services associated with those fees. Except as expressly provided in these Terms, all fees paid via the BFT 
                        Service are non-refundable once paid.

                        BFT may provide Food Truck Members with access to third party consumer reporting agencies that perform, among other things, personal identification

                        verifications (collectively, “<strong>Background Checks</strong>”). Outside of the US and Canada, these services are limited to Identity Verification. We do not provide, and are

                        regarding the reliability of such Background Checks or Identity Verifications or the accuracy, timeliness or completeness of any information in the Background 
                        Checks or Identity Verifications. We do not independently verify information in the Background Checks or Identity Verifications.

                        understand and agree that BFT may, in its sole discretion, review and rely on the information in the Background Check or Identity Verification in deciding 
                        whether to suspend or terminate or investigate a complaint about a Food Truck Member, but also that we are not obligated to do so, and are not responsible or 
                        liable in any way in the event that any information in any Background Check or Identity Verification is not accurate, timely or complete. If you are the subject of a 
                        Background Check or Identity Verification, you may contact the applicable third-party consumer reporting agency to dispute the accuracy, timeliness or 
                        completeness of such information. You agree that BFT’s rights and obligations under the Arbitration Agreement inure to the benefit of the consumer reporting 
                        agency used for Background Checks or Identity Verification in respect of any claim that would be subject to the Arbitration Agreement if brought against us. 
                        BFT reserves the right to suspend or terminate your access to the BFT Service based on information in the Background Check or Identity Verification or for any 
                        other reason, or no reason, in our sole discretion.

                        Checks may vary by type, breadth and depth. Records not available to third-party Background Check agencies will not be included in the results. Not all arrest

                        is a delay before arrest logs and records, conviction and correction records, sex offender registries and motor vehicle records are included in Background 
                        Checks. Juvenile records and offenses for minors may not appear in the public record and are therefore not included in the results. Dismissed cases, arrests not 
                        resulting in convictions, arrests or convictions in foreign countries and nolle prose qui (abandonment of prosecution) may not be reported. Traffic violations are 
                        not included unless a jurisdiction reports them as criminal offenses. In the jurisdictions where traffic violations are reported as criminal offenses, such traffic 
                        violations may be included in the results as misdemeanors or felonies.</strong>

                        <u>14.1 Exclusion of Certain Types of Damages.</u> To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, in no event will BFT be liable to you for any indirect,

                    <strong>15. Governing Law and Jurisdiction.</strong>
                    <p>
                        <u>15.1 For users in the United States and Canada,</u> these Terms, and any dispute between you and BFT, will be governed by the laws of the State of North 
                        Carolina, without regard to principles of conflicts of law. Unless you and we agree otherwise, or except where prohibited by applicable law, not to apply to you 
                        or to a particular claim or dispute, you agree that any claim or dispute that arises between you and BFT must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court 
                        located in the State of North Carolina. You and BFT agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Charlotte, North Carolina, for the 
                        purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes.
                    </p>
                    <strong>16. Miscellaneous.</strong>
                    <p>
                        Nothing in these Terms will be construed as making either party the partner, joint venturer, agent, legal representative, employer, worker, or employee of the 
                        other. Neither party will have, or hold itself out to any third party as having, any authority to make any statements, representations or commitments of any kind, 
                        or to take any action, that will be binding on the other, except as provided for herein or authorized in writing by the party to be bound. These Terms are non-
                        exclusive and do not prohibit Service Providers from offering pet care services via other means or third parties. The invalidity, illegality or not enforceability of 
                        any term or provision of these Terms will in no way effect the validity, legality or enforceability of any other term or provision of these Terms. In the event a term 
                        or provision is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and 
                        enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and these Terms will be enforceable as so 
                        modified. To the maximum extent possible under applicable local law, this Agreement will be binding on and will inure to the benefit of the legal 
                        representatives, successors and assigns of the parties hereto.
                    </p>
