                Simply put, the BFT Guarantee is our commitment to you in the rare instance that something goes wrong during a booking. We offer the Guarantee because we 
                believe that being there for our community is a fundamental part of Food Truck Catering.

            <p>
                The BFT Guarantee reimburses members of our community for costs arising from certain injuries or damages that occur during a catering service booked and 
                paid through BFT. The injuries or damages must result from care provided during a BFT Food Truck Member stay and the Guarantee reimburses in the event 
                Food Truck Member is unwilling or unable to pay those costs. In certain cases, the Guarantee may also be used to reimburse for injuries to attendees of an event.

                damage to precious goods such as fine art or family heirlooms, are excluded. For a complete understanding of the BFT Guarantee, including the full list of 
                conditions, exclusions and limitations, we strongly encourage you to read the 
                <a href="#" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="text-link">BFT Guarantee Terms and Conditions</a>, which are part and parcel of <a href="#" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="text-link">BFT's Terms of Service</a>.

            <h6 class="mb-3 mt-5">Is the Booking Food Truck Guarantee an insurance plan?</h6>
            <p>
                No. The BFT Guarantee exists to fill the gap when the responsible party—usually Food Truck Member—is unable or unwilling to pay for costs arising from 
                damage or injury attributable to his or her negligence, and when insurance is not available. It is a contractual agreement from BFT to protect its users, 
                enforceable in accordance with the <a href="#" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="text-link">BFT Guarantee Terms and Conditions</a>. Reimbursement under the Rover Guarantee is generally paid out of BFT own pocket
                —though we reserve the right to refer a claim to our insurance carriers when necessary or appropriate.

            <p>
                In many cases, BFT’s Trust & Safety team can help users take immediate steps to mitigate the injury or damage caused by an incident. We ask both Food Truck 
                Members and Buyer Services to notify us as soon as possible after an incident occurs—and in any event no later than 48 hours after the booking. We can’t help 
                what we don’t know about, so make us your first call!
            </p>
            <p>
                When it comes to reimbursement, however, we know from experience that issues are often best resolved by simply reaching out to the other party. Before 
                filing a claim for reimbursement under the BFT Guarantee, try contacting the other party through your <a href="<?php echo site_url('account/inbox/'); ?>" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="text-link">BFT inbox</a>. If you're unable to come to an agreement informally, let us know.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, if you have insurance that may cover some or all costs arising from an injury or damage otherwise falling under the BFT Guarantee, such as an 
                homeowner’s insurance, you should file a claim under that policy before seeking reimbursement from BFT. In such a case the BFT Guarantee may be leveraged 
                to meet deductibles or cover costs that fall outside your policy.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are unable to reach an agreement with the responsible party and don’t have insurance to cover costs arising from an injury or damage covered under the 
                BFT Guarantee, you can submit a claim for reimbursement as outlined below.

            <p class="mb-5">
                To qualify, a BTF catering related to the reimbursable incident must have been booked <b>and</b> paid on BookingFoodTrucks.com, and the injury or damage must 
                have occurred during the booked date(s).
            </p>
            <!--// How do I submit a claim ... -->
            <h6>How do I submit a claim for reimbursement?</h6>
            <p>
                Contact our Trust & Safety (see contact details below) We'll guide you through the claims process. Keep in mind we must be notified within 48 hours of the end of the BFT booked event.
            </p>
            <p>
                All claim-related information will be evaluated to determine if the incident is the result of care provided during a BFT booked event. We'll reach out to everyone 
                involved to gather as much information as possible, including a written statement from each party. These documents will play a key role in the review process.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-5">The process may vary. We'll work as quickly as possible with hopes of resolving all claims within 14 days of receiving all appropriate documentation.</p>

            <p class="mb-5">
                Refunds and reimbursement are considered on a case-by-case basis. BFT requires that Buyers of Services and Food Truck Members attempt to work together 
                with regard to refunds for services, so before filing a reimbursement claim, try contacting the other party through your BFT inbox as your first step.

                parties found at fault can range from coaching to removal from the platform. We'll always do our best to come to a fair resolution.
